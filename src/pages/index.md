  Creating brands, designing logos, illustrating, making websites, building
  print collateral, and animating shorts. In July of 2018 she created Your
  Grandma Lied Studios, a boutique branding shop which she runs with her partner
  and talented friends from New York, New York.


  She’s given talks at conferences all over the world about the spaces where
  design and technology intersect. She writes on the subject along with mental
  health, immigration, and web development here.


  As of 2019 her most recent side projects include auditing design courses at
  Parsons at the New School, writing short stories, and sewing, all of which are
  catalogued here.

  \### About


  Before going solo she worked for Friendly Design Co., a military contractor in
  Northern Virginia, Capital One, and Mozilla Firefox. At university she studied
  graphic design with a concentration in interaction and learned to code through
  a collection of computer science classes, internships, and jobs. During her
  first year of freelance she worked for big names like Github, Heroku, and
  Fastly before establishing her own studio Your Grandma Lied. She now does a
  little bit of everything, including management, sales, and finances.


  Nowadays the kinds of projects that excite her and her colleagues at Your
  Grandma Lied are projects that need wholistic branding solutions such as
  conferences, off-sites, parties, restaurants, and any other client that’s
  looking for weird, interesting solutions to brand everything from their invite
  to their space.


  If that sounds like a project you’re looking for design assistance on, contact
  Helen and her team at

  As of 2019 I am not taking on speaking engagements.

  What I've accomplished thus far in Q1 toward my 2019 Resolution to learn to
  sew.

Learning to sew has long been a goal, but at the beginning of the year Brian and I began reading [_Overdressed: The Shockingly High Cost of Cheap Fashion_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11797414-overdressed) and it finally lit the fire under me to take out the sewing machine that I've been scared of out of its box. The book has been a fascinating (if tough) read and it has inspired a lot of further research that I've covered in another post because of how long it was making this one. You can read that post [here](#here). It covers things like what our philosophy has been since starting the book when it comes to buying new clothing, how we vet brands, and a list of brands that fit our philosophy for buying ethically.

Thus far, I've created:

**A napkin** out of the back of a black t-shirt we planned on donating from a Google swag drive:

The wooden hoop is an embroidery hoop, since I planned to begin embroidering after I took these photos. The second is a close-up of the seam—not particularly elegant, and there is a stain you can see of where when I was ironing I accidentally ironed on some plastic from my sewing needles pouch. Wowza.

Since this was my first piece _ever_, it's not much to look at. I didn't know how to use my sewing machine yet, so I followed [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/rnTwT-ifLkU) on Youtube to set up [my machine](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VV4ZWBQ/ref=oh_aui_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). (As far as tutorials go, I love this one, and am hoping to check out her following tutorial on skirt making at some point.) If I was to re-do this now I'd probably not choose a knit fabric because of how stretchy it was—it was harder to get straight lines.

After sewing the napkin I did some **embroidery on said napkin.** 

* Darts in vintage wool pants from L.L.Bean
* Repairing two pairs of jeans
* Altered green "Emotional Aesthetics" shirt from Zara
* Four handkerchiefs out of a linen napkin my mother bought me from Sur la Table

The projects I'm planning to work on next:

**Embroidering my new handkerchiefs,** each with a different permutation of the letter "H". Obviously one will be this site's logo. I have a few variations drawn of an Edwardian-esque script for the second, which leaves me with two designs to dream up. I'm excited for this since I think it will really make these feel like mine.

**Altering my favorite t-shirts,** which is a big deal. I bought three of them in black from [Grana](https://www.grana.com/) in 2015 and they've served me well. I to this day use them basically all the time. I'd like to alter two of them in the following ways:

* I've had my eye on [this shirt](https://www.vettacapsule.com/collections/tops/products/the-convertible-tee?variant=8985870925860) from Vetta (both in black and white) and was considering buying it when for weeks my size wasn't available. When something _would_ **__**become available, another piece I wanted to buy wouldn't be. (I really wanted to combine my orders to cut down on shipping costs.) I realized that I could modify an existing shirt I already had to mimic this (although mine will have a pocket) so for one shirt I'm planning to create a slit on the side and open up the neck hole so I can wear it off the shoulder if I'd like. (Because the shirts are four years old at this point the hems are pretty stretched at the neck, so I think I can get away with taking the existing hemline off with a seam ripper and reattaching it to the widened neck—we'll see.) If this goes well I think I'll be on the lookout for a white cotton tee at thrift stores to have a matching set in black and white.
* On the second, I'd like to take up the bottom by about an inch. They're box tees, so having them be shorter than your average tee makes them more feminine without curving to the body, but I feel like at my height they're just a tad too long. This should be an easy change. I'm planning to take it up and cut off the fabric once I've tried it on and determined that I've gotten the length right. If I like how this looks I might to it to the remaining tee.
* All three of them have developed small holes from general wear-and-tear, so I'll be repairing those as well.

**Creating a sleeping pack puffer,** which is another DIY from [with wendy](https://www.youtube.com/user/withwendy). I have a sleeping bag in storage that is primary colors and I think would look really cool for this project. An added benefit of this project is that it means I can return the super expensive Canada Goose that I recently bought for the season. I'm hoping to make a few modifications from Wendy's design on top of an already challenging project but I think it will be a coat that lasts me for years:

* A hood (which will be tricky because the tutorial doesn't include it and hoods on every puffer jacket I've ever owned has been sort of wonky and hard to see out of when up, so... yeah, we'll see). Brian's jacket has a hood that works for me, so I'll try to use his as a pattern guide.
* Backpack hangs on the inside of the jacket. This is a little hard to describe, but the Canada Goose jacket I own has these and I think it's a really cool little extra thing. In essence, there are straps on the inside of it so you can wear your coat sort of like a backpack. I've found this to be really handy in bars where there are no coat hooks, although I've had to be conscientious about who's behind me because it sprouts off my back just like a backpack. 
* Jersey knit sleeve finishes. My Canada Goose has these as well, I think they're sort of a necessity for not letting cold air up the sleeve of your coat.
* Buckles to roll it up like a sleeping bag. The sleeping bag I'm reusing already has these so I'd like to figure out a way to reattach these so that I can fold it up like a sleeping bag still. I live in a small New York apartment, so having a good way to fold this up nice and small in the off-season is an awesome idea.
* Two sets of pockets. Another Canada Goose copy. My current coat has one set of unlined pockets with large buttons for things like keys, my wallet, etc., and a set of lined pockets as hand warmers. 
* An interior pocket for valuables. Mens jackets often have these in lieu of carrying a bag, but since I often go sans-purse this would be a nice addition. I might also research RFID blocking material to keep my wallet and phone digitally safe as well.
* A large mesh pocket on the inside. Wendy's project actually did include this, and I'd like to keep it on my final coat as well—I like to use pockets like these to keep my hat with my coat. I also like the double zipper so you can unzip it from the bottom or the top; a lot of time I unzip mine from the bottom to grab my hat when I realize it is freezing outside.
* Lastly, a coat hook. I'm not certain if Wendy's end product included this, but it's a must. 

Creating this will require buying some new materials (ribbon to finish the inside, a zipper, potentially a mesh pocket, potentially some soft jersey to line the hand warmer, some elastic for the coat hang) so I'm going to scrounge around thrift stores to see if I can thrift those things before I head out to any fabric stores. (I assume I'll end up at one eventually, but for now I've been enjoying the sustainability challenge on the heels of reading _Overdressed_.) 

I think the puffer jacket in particular will carry me through to Q2 (possibly even beyond when I have need of the coat), which is totally fine. I've been using Pinterest to create moodboards of things I'd like to attempt next along with Youtube to create playlists of tutorials I'd like to try out. I also recently thrifted a book called _Vogue Sewing_ that I haven't even cracked yet but looks like it's full of cool patterns and tutorials, so I have more ideas than time at the moment.

If this inspired you in any way, I'd love to hear about it at sayhi@helenvholmes.com. I know it's weird to cold-email someone, but I don't mind.

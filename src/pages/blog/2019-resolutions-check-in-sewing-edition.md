  What I've accomplished thus far in Q1 toward my 2019 Resolution to learn to
  sew.

Learning to sew has long been a goal, but at the beginning of the year Brian and I began reading [_Overdressed: The Shockingly High Cost of Cheap Fashion_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/11797414-overdressed) and it finally lit the fire under me to take out the sewing machine that I've been scared of out of its box. The book has been a fascinating (if tough) read and it has inspired a lot of further research that I've covered in another post because of how long it was making this one. You can read that post here. It covers things like what our philosophy has been since starting the book when it comes to buying new clothing, how we vet brands, and a list of brands that fit our philosophy for buying ethically.

Thus far, I've created:

**A napkin** out of the back of a black t-shirt we planned on donating from a Google swag drive:

The wooden hoop is an embroidery hoop, since I planned to begin embroidering after I took these photos. The second is a close-up of the seam—not particularly elegant, and there is a stain you can see of where when I was ironing I accidentally ironed on some plastic from my sewing needles pouch. Wowza.

Since this was my first piece _ever_, it's not much to look at. I didn't know how to use my sewing machine yet, so I followed [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/rnTwT-ifLkU) on Youtube to set up [my machine](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00VV4ZWBQ/ref=oh_aui_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1). (As far as tutorials go, I love this one, and am hoping to check out her following tutorial on skirt making at some point.) If I was to re-do this now I'd probably not choose a knit fabric because of how stretchy it was—it was harder to get straight lines.

After sewing the napkin I did some **embroidery on said napkin.** 

* Darts in vintage wool pants from L.L.Bean
* Altered green "Emotional Aesthetics" shirt from Zara
* Four handkerchiefs out of a linen napkin my mother bought me from Sur la Table

The projects I'm planning to work on next:

**Altering my favorite t-shirts,** which is a big deal. I bought three of them in black from [Grana](https://www.grana.com/) in 2015 and they've served me well. I to this day use them basically all the time. I'd like to alter two of them in the following ways:

* I've had my eye on [this shirt](https://www.vettacapsule.com/collections/tops/products/the-convertible-tee?variant=8985870925860) from Vetta (both in black and white) and was considering buying it when for weeks my size wasn't available. When something _would_ **__**become available, another piece I wanted to buy wouldn't be. (I really wanted to combine my orders to cut down on shipping costs.) I realized that I could modify an existing shirt I already had to mimic this (although mine will have a pocket) so for one shirt I'm planning to create a slit on the side and open up the neck hole so I can wear it off the shoulder if I'd like. (Because the shirts are four years old at this point the hems are pretty stretched at the neck, so I think I can get away with taking the existing hemline off with a seam ripper and reattaching it to the widened neck—we'll see.) If this goes well I think I'll be on the lookout for a white cotton tee at thrift stores to have a matching set in black and white.
* On the second, I'd like to take up the bottom by about an inch. They're box tees, so having them be shorter than your average tee makes them more feminine without curving to the body, but I feel like at my height they're just a tad too long. This should be an easy change. I'm planning to take it up and cut off the fabric once I've tried it on and determined that I've gotten the length right. If I like how this looks I might to it to the remaining tee.
* All three of them have developed small holes from general wear-and-tear, so I'll be repairing those as well.

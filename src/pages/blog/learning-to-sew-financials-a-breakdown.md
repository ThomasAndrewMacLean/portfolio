2019 was the year I learned to sew. I've written quarterly updates (Q1 Q2 Q3 Q4) 

What I spent in 2018 on clothes

What I spent in 2017 on clothes

What I spent in 2019 on clothes

What I spent on sewing supplies in 2019

The difference

How it's made me feel about clothing

How my spending habits changed

How my mentality has changed (sweater I picked up out of a box in Washington Square Park that was wet? My dad used to do that shit)

<p>Sometimes you need to install something programmatically, such as when you're setting up a server from scratch (as you might if you were working with Digital Ocean). In those instances, you want to use <code>wget</code> or <code>curl</code>. </p>

<p>If you're installing Craft, you can get the zip file at <code>http://buildwithcraft.com/latest.zip?accept_license=yes</code>. A stack exchange post with more specifics can be found <a href="http://craftcms.stackexchange.com/questions/225/is-there-a-way-i-can-programmatically-download-the-latest-version-of-craft" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>I have by no means conquered SVN in the way that I normally barge into things, wanting to conqueror anything, everything, breaking shit, and peacing out. (Hey guys, want to hire me?) Anyway, SVN from what I can tell is Git's easier little brother that is terrible if you're a control freak and want intelligent version control. (I'm being disengenous because I obviously have a favorite, but whatever.)</p>

<p>Learned as of now:</p>

<p><code>git clone [repo-url]</code> : <code>svn checkout [repo-url]</code></p>

<p><code>git pull</code> : <code>svn up</code></p>

<p><code>git commit -m "[message]" && git push</code>: <code>svn commit -m "[message]"</code></p>

<p>Also learned: old male developers will tell you not to use things unless you're a 'command line wizard' because they don't know how to use the command line. Leaving it at that.</p>
